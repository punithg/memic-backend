# Cursor Rules for Memic Backend

## Code Style Guidelines

### No Emojis in Codebase
- Do not use emojis in any code files, comments, or strings
- Keep the codebase professional and clean
- Use clear, descriptive text instead of emojis

### Python Code Standards
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write clear docstrings for functions and classes
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### FastAPI Best Practices
- Use dependency injection for database sessions
- Implement proper error handling with HTTPException
- Use Pydantic models for request/response validation
- Follow MVC architecture pattern (Controllers → Services → Models → DTOs)

### Project Structure
- Keep controllers thin (HTTP handling only)
- Put business logic in services
- Use DTOs for data validation and serialization
- Keep models focused on database schema

### Environment and Configuration
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Never commit sensitive data to version control
- Use .env files for local development
- Document all required environment variables
